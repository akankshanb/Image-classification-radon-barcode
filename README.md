# Image-classification-radon-barcode

Different Indian architectural styles often show certain similar features which makes classification a difficult task. 
Previous work has focused on European architecture and standard datasets are available for the same, but no standard dataset exists for Indian architecture. 
Therefore, I have curated a dataset of Indian monuments.</br>
In this paper, I propose two approaches to classify monuments according to their styles: Radon Barcodes and Convolutional Neural Networks.

The code shows application of Radon barcode method and use of SIFT descriptors.
